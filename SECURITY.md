## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by email to `abacus-security@kolmogorov.ai`.
This email is an alias to a subset of the ABacus maintainers' team.

If the security vulnerability is accepted, a patch will be crafted privately
in order to prepare a dedicated bugfix release as timely as possible (depending
on the complexity of the fix).
